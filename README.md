# Sofle V2.1 ZMK
This is my ZMK wireless dongle conversion of the Sofle V2.1. The keyboard was originally bought from [Custom KBD](https://customkbd.com/collections/sofle/products/sofle-keyboard-kit-v2-1-rgb). 
You can find the original wired QMK build of the same keyboard in my other keyboard [repo](https://github.com/eriku-06/Sofle-V2.1-QMK-config).

The hardware includes:
  - Sofle V2.1 wired kit
  - 2x 18650 3.7V 2600mah batteries ([Jaycar](https://www.jaycar.com.au/18650-rechargeable-li-ion-battery-2600mah-3-7v/p/SB2308))
  - 3x [Tenstar nrf52840](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005009890279520.html)

I'm still working on designing a case that will integrate and fit the 18650 battery. 

The current ZMK configuration allows for ZMK studio usage.
