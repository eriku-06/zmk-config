# Sofle V2.1 ZMK
This is my ZMK wireless conversion of the Sofle V2.1. The keyboard was originally bought from [Custom KBD](https://customkbd.com/collections/sofle/products/sofle-keyboard-kit-v2-1-rgb). 
You can find the original wired QMK build of the same keyboard in my other keyboard [repo](https://github.com/eriku-06/Sofle-V2.1-QMK-config).

The hardware includes:
  - Sofle V2.1 wired kit
  - 18650 3.7V 2600mah batteries
  - Tenstar nrf52840

The current build uses 3x nrf52840 MCUs with one acting as the central dongle. 

I'm still working on designing a case that will integrate and fit the 18650 battery.
