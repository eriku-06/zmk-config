This is my ZMK wireless conversion of the Sofle V2.1. The keyboard was originally bought from Custom KBD (https://customkbd.com/collections/sofle/products/sofle-keyboard-kit-v2-1-rgb). 
You can find the original wired QMK build of the same keyboard in my other keyboard repo.

The hardware includes:
  - Sofle V2.1 wired kit
  - 18650 3.7V 2600mah batteries
  - Tenstar nrf52840
